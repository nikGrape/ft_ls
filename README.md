# ft_ls
### my own version of standard `ls` utility
`ls` is a command to list computer files and directories in Unix and Unix-like operating systems

Flags:
- `-R`      Recursively list subdirectories encountered.
- `-a`      Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (.).
- `-l`      List files in the long format, as: `-rwxr-xr-x   1 nik  staff  53944 Jun 5 09:24 ft_ls`
- `-r`      Reverse the order of the sort.
- `-t`      Sort by descending time modified (most recently modified first).
- output is colored by default
